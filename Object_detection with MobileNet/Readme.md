# Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV and Python

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model to detect objects in the video captured from a webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
- A webcam for real-time detection

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
