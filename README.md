## color_based_detection_tracking
This demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using Python and OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam and tracks green objects in real-time by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## mobilenet_objdetection
This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model to detect objects in the video captured from a webcam.
