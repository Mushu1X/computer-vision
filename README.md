# computer-vision

##over time I will be adding several vision based programs here

# color_based_detection_tracking
This demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using Python and OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam and tracks green objects in real-time by drawing bounding boxes around them.

# mobilenet_objdetection
This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model to detect objects in the video captured from a webcam.

## Setup and Run
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

### Installation
Install the required Python packages:

#requirements
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
