##over time I will be adding several vision based programs here

## color_based_detection_tracking.py
This project demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using Python and OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam and tracks green objects in real-time by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Setup and Run
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

### Installation
Install the required Python packages:

#requirements
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy


# Running color_based_detection_tracking.py
python object_tracking.py

Usage

    Point the webcam towards objects that are green.
    Press 'q' to quit the application.

Features

    Real-time video capture.
    Green color detection in the HSV color space.
    Contour detection and bounding box drawing.

Future Enhancements

    Add more color detections.
    Improve object tracking accuracy.
    Implement a user interface to change the target color dynamically.
