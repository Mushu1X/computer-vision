##over time I will be adding several vision based programs here

## color_based_detection_tracking.py
This project demonstrates real-time object detection and tracking using Python and OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam and tracks green objects in real-time by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Setup and Run
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
